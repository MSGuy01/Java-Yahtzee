# Java-Yahtzee
A Java console application for playing Yahtzee
To run this program, add all the class files and the run.bat file to a folder on your computer. Make sure you have Java installed to your PATH, and then run the run.bat file. This only works on Windows. If you have another OS, you can just copy the code from the java files into your IDE, and run them there.

# Update Notes
I am working on a better version of this program, and will have better UI and cleaner code.
